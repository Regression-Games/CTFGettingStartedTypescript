# Regression Games - Capture the Flag - Getting Started - TypeScript

PLEASE OPEN THE "TUTORIAL" TOOL IN THE REPLIT TOOLS PANE. Also, see the final code in `final_code.ts`

This template demonstrates the basics of using the [rg-bot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rg-bot) and [rg-ctf-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rg-ctf-utils) packages to create
a simple bot for the Regression Games: Capture the Flag challenge. At the end of
this tutorial, you will have a bot that can capture the flag and collect items.

**Please open this project in Replit, or see the Markdown files in `.tutorial/` for the tutorial.**
