Regression Games has announced our newest game mode and tournament, the Alpha Cup, which features a Capture the Flag game in Minecraft. In this tutorial, we will write a simple bot that reacts to events within the game to capture the flag and score it within your teamâ€™s base!

The Alpha Cup, sponsored by Steamship, is a 3v3 Capture the Flag tournament in Minecraft.
Players program bots in TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python to score points by capturing
flags and killing the opposing team. The first team to 10 flag captures wins! Learn more
